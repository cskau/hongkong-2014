## Eat and Drink

For lunch, try some Cantonese 'dim sum' or Shanghainese food.

Many restaurants offer discounts for customers who enter and order after 2:30pm
(which is considered to be the start of the 'afternoon tea' (下午茶) session
rather than the lunch session).


Try a local style breakfast at a tsa tsan teng (茶餐廳; literally 'tea restaurant')
in Mui Wo, a typical seaside town on Lantau Island which, as with most outlying
island settlements, has a small expat population.
The breakfast menu is a melange of Western and Chinese culinary influences.
You can get a filling cooked breakfast including tea or coffee for under HK$30
per person. For the drink, try a 'yeen yeung' (half tea and half coffee) - be
aware that Hong Kongers have their tea and coffee very strong (and sweet)!
Breakfast ranges from macaroni in a chicken soup broth with strips of ham (火腿通粉)
to instant noodles with spicy satay beef (沙爹牛肉公仔麵).


In addition to Sai Kung's watering holes (see above), in Tai Po Market there
are a number of pubs and country clubs along Kwong Fuk Rd and the adjacent
Luk Heung Ln, Tung Cheong St.
While lacking the glamour of Hong Kong Island's Central, the area offers more
reasonable prices and a friendlier, more local feel.
It is about a 5-minute walk from Tai Po Market MTR Stn.
Overnight transport is readily available on Kwong Fuk Rd to take you back to
downtown Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.



## Try and See

Take minibus number 1 from the Peak back down to Central
(HK$9.8 (ordinary single); departures every 10-15 minutes).
Taking the minibus is a must if you want to have a taste of the most popular
form of public transport for the locals!


The streets in Mong Kok in the evenings are very crowded - no visit to Hong Kong
can be complete without a personal experience of being in the midst of crowds
of people on narrow streets!
