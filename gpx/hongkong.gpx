    along the quayside, where you can pick your dinner from an aquarium and have
    it served any way you like. However, if downing a bucket of bottled beers
    whilst munching on a plate of crustaceans is not your thing, there is also
    a fairly good selection of eateries and watering holes to be found in the
    town centre. Prices here can be reasonable and the cuisine ranges from
    local to western. Various well-known burger and coffee shops have also found
    their way to this otherwise secluded part of Hong Kong.
